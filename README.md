# Price-Optimisation
Price optimization is a strategic method that leverages data on sales, costs, competition, and market trends to forecast demand shifts and assess price elasticity, helping businesses determine the most effective pricing. This approach includes competitive analysis to track market positioning, customer segmentation to understand different price sensitivities, and the application of mathematical optimization algorithms to identify ideal price points.
